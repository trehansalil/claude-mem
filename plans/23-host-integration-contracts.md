# [plan-23] Host Integration Contracts — every non-Claude-Code adapter and the MCP/HTTP tool surface validated by contract tests against the host's actual schema

## Defect

Each host integration (OpenCode plugin, Codex hooks, Antigravity CLI/IDE, hook-CLI platforms, transcript watcher, and the `mcp-search` MCP server / worker HTTP surface) is a hand-rolled adapter whose only test is "does the source file import". None of them is checked against the host's real loader/hook/tool schema, and the shared plumbing they depend on (port resolution, generator start, viewer source filter) has per-adapter forks:

- **OpenCode:** the plugin binds `chat.message` (removed upstream; now `message.updated`/`message.part.updated`), fires capture POSTs without awaiting, exports two `as const` arrays from the plugin entry that opencode's loader rejects (`Plugin export is not a function`) — regressed 13.4.0 → 13.4.1 and still present on 13.14.0 — resolves the worker port from env/defaults instead of `settings.json`, and the installer refreshes a stale 12.4.7 npx-cached plugin file. OpenCode is not a viewer source.
- **Codex:** `codex-hooks.json` emits `suppressOutput` (rejected by Codex), and POSIX shell command strings with no `commandWindows` so the Windows Codex app runs them through PowerShell (`ParserError`).
- **Antigravity / transcript watcher:** `--ide antigravity` wires only `agy` CLI hooks while the GUI IDE never fires them; the transcript watcher's `Bun.Glob` lacks `dot: true` so the IDE's `.system_generated/logs/transcript_full.jsonl` is never discovered; the Windows agy path records nothing; the installer depends on a marketplace file it does not install; the custom watch schema is undocumented.
- **Hook-CLI platforms:** `worker-service.cjs hook <platform> observation` returns `{"status":"queued"}` but the generator never starts for sessions registered through `/api/sessions/init` outside Claude Code.
- **MCP / HTTP surface:** tool definitions have no `annotations.readOnlyHint` so plan mode re-prompts every session; server-beta `observation_add` loses `content` between the protocol layer and the handler; `claude mcp list` renders the entry garbled; `skillOverrides: off` does not hide bundled skill descriptions and there is no plugin-level opt-out of the smart-* tools; the CORS allowlist regressed to localhost-only prefixes so settings cannot be saved from a LAN viewer (was #1029); the stdio MCP server closes after ~59 s when the worker fails to start (Windows).

The fix is a contract per host — a checked-in fixture of the host's loader/hook/tool schema, an adapter that is generated or validated against it in CI, and shared resolvers (port, project, generator start) instead of forks.

Related PRs to evaluate/rebase: #2855, #2985 (OpenCode events + await), #2953 (Codex suppressOutput), #3208 (OpenCode port), #3527 (readOnlyHint), #3070 (remote MCP), #2699/#2679 (Codex Windows), #1214 (original CORS fix). Net-new hosts (Hermes #2825, Goose #3329, omp #3355, HTTP/SSE MCP transport #3086) are tracked on the roadmap master #2785 and become cheap once this contract exists.

## Fix sequence

1. **Host schema fixtures + contract tests.** Check in the loader/hook/tool schema for each host version we claim to support (`fixtures/hosts/opencode-<ver>.json`, `codex-hooks-<ver>.json`, `antigravity-<ver>.json`, `claude-code-mcp-annotations.json`); CI imports the *built* `dist/opencode-plugin/index.js` and asserts every export is a function or `{server: fn}`, that registered hook names ⊆ the host's event list, and that Codex hook JSON contains only host-accepted keys and has `commandWindows` for every entry.
2. **Adapters share resolvers.** OpenCode plugin, Codex adapter, Antigravity/transcript watcher, and hook-CLI all call the same `resolveWorkerEndpoint()` (settings.json → env → default, `CLAUDE_MEM_DATA_DIR`-aware), the same `resolveProjectIdentity()` (plan-20), and the same `ensureGeneratorRunning(sessionDbId)` so a session initialized from any host generates; every capture POST is awaited with a bounded timeout.
3. **Antigravity IDE and custom transcripts.** `Bun.Glob(..., {dot: true})`; a built-in Antigravity IDE schema; the custom `transcript-watch.json` schema documented with a validator command; `--ide antigravity` reports honestly which surface (CLI vs IDE) is captured; installer refreshes host plugin files on upgrade and prints the version installed.
4. **MCP/HTTP surface.** `readOnlyHint: true` on all read-only tools and annotations forwarded in `tools/list`; server-beta write tools pass `content` through (integration test on the MCP protocol path, not the handler); a plugin-level `CLAUDE_MEM_MCP_TOOLS` allowlist to trim `smart_*`; skill descriptions honor `skillOverrides`/`CLAUDE_MEM_SKILLS_DISABLED`; CORS allows same-host origins and a `CLAUDE_MEM_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` list with a JSON error body; `mcp-server.cjs` reports a clean name/title/description and exits promptly with a reason when the worker cannot be reached (plan-15 owns worker start).
5. **Viewer.** `platform_source` propagates end-to-end and the source filter is generated from distinct values (OpenCode, Codex, Antigravity, Cursor, hook-CLI).

## Test matrix

| Host | Version(s) | Scenario | Required behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| OpenCode | 1.16, 1.17, 1.18 | load + one tool call + one message | plugin loads; `/api/sessions/init|observations|summarize` received on the settings.json port; observation stored with `platform_source=opencode` |
| Codex CLI / Codex App | current, on macOS + Windows | PostToolUse | hook accepted (no unsupported keys); Windows runs `commandWindows`; observation stored |
| Antigravity CLI + IDE | current | session | CLI: hooks capture; IDE: transcript watcher discovers dot-dir transcript and ingests |
| hook-CLI (`hook <platform>`) | any | init + observation | generator starts; observation row exists ≤ 60 s |
| Claude Code plan mode | current | `search`, `timeline`, `get_observations`, `smart_*` | no permission prompt (readOnlyHint) |
| server-beta MCP | current | `observation_add` over stdio | row written |
| viewer from `http://<lan-host>:<port>` | current | settings save | 200; CORS same-host allowed; explicit deny returns JSON 403 |
| Codex | current | `enabled_tools`/`CLAUDE_MEM_MCP_TOOLS` | only listed tools advertised |

The matrix lives in CI (`tests/integrations/*-contract.test.ts` against checked-in host fixtures, plus a Docker job that installs the real OpenCode CLI). A regression must fail CI before a user can file.

## Out of scope

Claude Code's own hook wrapper (plan-17). Which plugin copy the installer materializes (plan-16). Worker start/liveness behind the MCP server (plan-15). New host integrations (roadmap #2785).

## Round: 2026-09-12 oh-my-issues

- **#4057** — Antigravity CLI (`agy` 1.2.1) records zero observations on Windows, from four independent unchecked mismatches found by disassembling `agy.exe` against the adapter: (1) the installer writes hooks to `~/.gemini/settings.json`, but `agy` reads `hooks.json` (`.agents/hooks.json` or a plugin `hooks.json`); (2) it registers legacy Gemini event names — the binary has **0 occurrences** of `BeforeTool`, `AfterTool`, `BeforeAgent`; Antigravity dispatches `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PreInvocation`, `PostInvocation`, `Stop`; (3) `agy` speaks camelCase protojson (`conversationId`, `workspacePaths`, `transcriptPath`, `toolCall`, `stepIdx`) and expects `{"decision":"allow"}` / `{"injectSteps":[...]}` / `{}` back, while claude-mem returns `{"continue":true,"systemMessage":"..."}`; (4) transcripts use `type: PLANNER_RESPONSE` / `USER_INPUT` with top-level `content`, not `type: assistant` with `message.content`.

  Four mismatches none of which any test catches is the case this plan exists for — the adapter's only test today is "does the source file import". Ship path: narrow rehost onto current `main` inside `AntigravityCliHooksInstaller.ts`, `src/cli/adapters/antigravity-cli.ts`, the Antigravity transcript branch, and `tests/antigravity-cli-compat.test.ts` — explicitly not by reusing #3742 (mixes OpenCode) or #3397 (stale, large bundled rebuild). The RCA-later half stays here: a checked-in live `agy` schema fixture validated in CI, or this recurs on `agy` 1.3. See PR #4058.
